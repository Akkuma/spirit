This is in contrast to other web libraries that can only transform the request. This is a simple idea but having this feature allows for much more DRY and expressive code.\nGiven the above, it's much more easier to re-use, test, and reason about your code in spirit.\nOh yea, most Express middleware work in spirit too!\nGetting Started\nThe Handbook\n\ncollection of Examples\nspirit API Docs\nspirit + spirit-router Guide\nIntroduction Video.\n\nNotable Components\n\nspirit is a small library for composing functions and creating abstractions. Abstractions are defined in a \"spirit adapter\". Currently it comes with 1 builtin, the node adapter (spirit.node) for use with node.js's http modules. Eventually there will be another one written for spirit to run in the browser.\n\nspirit-router is a library for routing and creating routes.\n\nspirit-common is a library that provides many common http related middleware. It's purpose is to make bootstrapping a multitude of middleware that everyone will need easier.\n\nspirit-express, is a library for converting most Express middleware to work in spirit.\n\n\nContributing\nAll contributions are appreciated and welcomed.\nFor backwards incompatible changes, or large changes, it would be best if you opened an issue before hand to outline your plans (to avoid conflict later on).\nThe code style omits ending semi-colons. It also does not use camel case. And one-liners should be avoided unless it's very clear.\nTo run tests, use make test. This will also build changes to src/*, if you do not have \"make\" installed, you can look at the Makefile to see the steps to accomplish the task.\nCredits\nspirit is heavily influenced by the design of Ring\n"},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Install spirit and spirit-router: \n$ npm install spirit spirit-router\n\nStart off with a simple app:\nconst {adapter} = require(\"spirit\").node\nconst route = require(\"spirit-router\")\n\nconst hello = () => {\n  return \"Hello World!\"\n}\n\nconst app = route.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", [], hello)\n])\n\nconst http = require(\"http\")\nconst server = http.createServer(adapter(app))\nserver.listen(3000)\n\nIf we run our example and visit http://localhost:3000 in a browser, you will be greeted with Hello World!\nSeparation of code\nOur hello() function is just a normal javascript function, what gets returned is what is sent back as the response.\nIt does not need to deal with a req or res object.\nSeparation of concerns is a central concept to spirit.\nIf we think about a web request in it's simpliest form, it's basically a function, it takes a input (request) and returns an output (response). So why not write web applications this way?\nspirit simplifies everything by abstracting away the complexity of req and res that normally resulted in impure and complex functions.\nRoutes as definitions\nRoutes in spirit should be thought of as definitions and not some proprietary operation to perform.\n  route.get(\"/\", [], hello)\n\nWhen we defined this route, do not think of hello as a \"routing function\". \nWhen we define a route, we are simply describing the when and how. When should we call hello, and how to call it.\nRoutes in spirit serve as a boundary between http related ideas and regular javascript.\nAdapter\nconst server = http.createServer(adapter(app))\nserver.listen(3000)\n\nspirit has a concept of an adapter where most of the abstractions happen. \nspirit comes with an adapter already for node.js. It converts our routes and app into something node.js's http module can understand.\nIt can optionally take middlewares adapter(app, _middleware_) (more on that in Using Middleware).\n"},"request.html":{"url":"request.html","title":"Request","keywords":"","body":"If a web request can be simply thought of as a function, that is it takes an input (request) and returns an output (response), then how do we get the input (the request) into our function?\nIn the previous chapter our hello function did not need any information from the request and took no arguments, but what if our function looked like this:\nconst hello = (url) => {\n  return \"Hello from \" + url\n}\n\nRemember a route can be thought of as a definition, describing when a route is considered matched (more on this in Defining Routes) and how to call our function when it is matched.\nSo therefore we can tell it how to call our function, that is with what arguments.\nDependency Injection\nIn order to run our new hello function above we define our routes like so:\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", [\"url\"], hello)\n])\n\nNotice the [\"url\"], this tells our route that in order for our hello function to run successfully, we depend on \"url\" being passed into our hello function.\nAnd \"url\" is looked up off the request (which is an object) for us and hello is called with it's value. This is a form of dependency injection.\nTo expand on this further and to include more dependencies:\nconst hello = (url, method) => {\n  return \"Hello from \" + method + \" \" + url\n}\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", [\"url\", \"method\"], hello)\n])\n\nWhich would produce \"Hello from GET /\".\nWhy Dependency Injection?\nYou may be wondering why use dependency injection over just passing the entire request into our function.\nAfter all when working with node.js and other web libraries previously you may have gotten use to something like this:\nconst hello = (req, res) => {\n  res.send(\"Hello from \" + req.method + \" \" + req.url) \n}\n\nThis goes against spirit's philosophy of being re-usuable, testable and readable! \nEven if we went half way where our function still returned by the request was always passed in, this breaks our re-usuable philosophy! \nWe can no longer re-use hello() in some other part of our code that doesn't have a request to give it. \nIt also breaks testability! If we wanted to test our hello() function, we would have to mock an entire request object.\nBesides, if our function only needs 2 arguments (both strings), why pass it more information than it needs to run?\nAnd when we re-use our function, all we are concerned about now is satisfying it's arguments of providing it with 2 values that are strings.\nAs mentioned in the previous chapter, do not think of routes as having \"routing functions\". spirit tries to avoid http from leaking into your code and wants you to avoid writing bloated functions with complex dependencies.\nInstead think of them as normal functions that return a value and have real functional signatures.\n\nOr if you are familiar with functional programming, think of them more in that sense. Writing leaner and more pure functions.\n\nrequest is not req\nreq has been abstracted and simplified in spirit, and is called a request (or sometimes called request map).\nrequest and req are not the same thing, but have a similar purpose in that they both represent and hold data from an incoming http request.\nIt can be thought of as a \"JSON-like\" object. Or can be thought of as a hash, dict, or map in other programming languages.\nUnlike req it only has a few properties (or keys) with simple values associated with them.\nA request always has the following properties: port, host, ip, url, method, protocol, scheme, headers, query. See the API doc for more info.\nMore properties can be added to the request (usually through middleware, such as a 'body'). spirit-router also adds the property 'param' to request. More on this in Defining Routes.\nSometimes you might need the request or req object for a route, which you can also inject it in:\nconst inspect = (request) => {\n  return JSON.stringify(request)\n}\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", [\"request\"], inspect)\n])\n\n"},"response.html":{"url":"response.html","title":"Response","keywords":"","body":"const hello = () => {\n  return \"Hello World!\"\n}\n\nconst app = route.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", [], hello)\n])\n\nWhen we ran our very first example above, it worked, we see \"Hello World!\" in our browser. \nBut you may wonder how it's possible since a http response requires more information such as a status code or headers.\nResponse\nIn the previous chapter Request, you saw how a request is abstracted to be a simple JSON-like object, the same applies to a response (or sometimes called response map).\nA response is a JSON-like object (or can be thought of as a hash, dict, map in other programming languages) representing the response intended to be sent back to a client (browser).\nA response is basically an object literal with 3 properties: status, headers, body (optional).\nJust like a request can be passed around in spirit, so can a response. This is in contrast to other web libraries. You will see this more in later chapters dealing with middleware.\nstatus would be a number corresponding to the http status code of the response.\nheaders is a object with key, value pairs for it's respective http response header.\nbody is the response body to write back to the client, it is optional. If it exists, it must be either string, buffer, stream, file stream, or undefined.\nRoute as a gateway\nAs mentioned previously routes act as a boundary or gateway between http related code and your code.\nWhen a route is matched and calls your function, it will check the return value in a process called rendering. If the value is not a response map, it will render it to be one with some smart assumptions.\nThe above hello() returns \"Hello World!\" which gets converted to a response:\n{ status: 200, \n  headers: {\n    Content-Type: \"text/html; charset=utf-8\" },\n  body: \"Hello World!\" }\n\nTo spirit both of the following functions are equivalent:\nconst hello = () => {\n  return \"Hello World!\"\n}\n\nconst hello2 = () => {\n  return { status: 200, headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\" }, body: \"Hello World!\" }\n}\n\nIf we wanted to test or re-use the second function (hello2()) and get our original value \"Hello World!\", we can just read the 'body' property:\nhello2().body // \"Hello World!\"\n\nWhich is still easier than mocking a res object to pass in and extract information from it.\nOften times you will not need to write out a response map, but it's important to understanding how spirit works.\nContent Length\nIf you noticed our response map examples above are missing an important response header: \"Content-Length\". spirit.node.adapter will automatically fill this property for us when the response body is a string or buffer and we did not specify our own \"Content-Length\". \nSo we can leave this out of our response when working with a response body that is a string or a buffer.\nA undefined body will result in \"Content-Length\" being 0.\nCustom Responses & Extending\nThere are helper functions for creating responses when you want a more custom response. Explained in Return From Routes.\nRendering in spirit (the process of converting return values to a response map) can be extended as well! So any return value can customized to suit your web application.\nEven custom return values can be created, such as an returning an object like { file: \"my_file.md\", html: true }.\nThis is explained in Rendering Routes.\n"},"async.html":{"url":"async.html","title":"Async Routes","keywords":"","body":"Our examples so far have been synchrounous, but in a real world application you will want to do asynchrounous tasks, such as querying a database or reading a file.\nThis can be accomplished by returning a Promise of the value.\nMost libraries support Promises, such as Mongoose:\nconst db = (title) => {\n  return Books.findOne({ name: title })\n}\n\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/api/books/:title\", [\"title\"], db)\n])\n\nWhen you have a Promise already, you can just return it.\nOf course if you there are more things to do, you can then it and handle any errors with catch like normal:\nconst db = (title) => {\n  return Books.findOne({ name: title })\n      .then((book) => {\n        // do something with book / modify it\n        return book\n      }).catch((err) => {\n        return \"There was an error\"\n      })\n}\n\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/api/books/:title\", [\"title\"], db)\n])\n\nYour db() function has nothing to do with http, it's simply a database query function, which can re-used elsewhere in your application.\nWrapping Callbacks\nIf a library you are using doesn't support Promises, you can always it as a Promise.\nFor example let's take node.js's fs library:\nconst readfile = () => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    fs.readFile(\"my-file.txt\", (err, data) => {\n      err ? reject(err) : resolve(data)\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/read-file\", [], readfile)\n])\n\nThis isn't special to spirit, our readfile() is just writing javascript. The only thing http related is where we defined our route.\nThere are libraries that automatically wrap other libraries's API to be a Promise. One library that does this for us is bluebird.\n\nbluebird is recommended when creating Promises, though not required. You can always use the native Promise implementation that node.js already supports.\n\nAsync / Await\nIt's worth mentioning you can use ES7 async/await too when working with Promises.\nThere is nothing inherently special about using async/await with spirit, or Promises in general. So you would set it up and write it as as normal. Setting it up (via babeljs) is outside the scope of this guide.\n"},"defining-routes.html":{"url":"defining-routes.html","title":"Defining Routes","keywords":"","body":"As mentioned in previous chapters, a route just describes when and how to call the function we passed in.\nIn the previous chapters we focused on how it calls our function, now we will talk more about when a route is matched.\n\nRemember when you see route, it's imported from spirit-router from our very first example.\n\nconst route = require(\"spirit-router\")\n\nCreating Routes\nRoutes are always grouped with define, even if we only have 1 route:\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", [], some_function)\n])\n\nThis specifies the route will match and call our some_function with no arguments []. It will match when the incoming request is a GET / request. That is, the request is a GET method, for path /.\nSince there are no arguments, we can optionally omit it and write the above example as:\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", some_function)\n])\n\nRoutes are tried in the order they first appear, and are considered matched when the incoming request's method and path matches the routes. Once this happens, the function for the route will be called with any arguments defined.\nHowever, the router will only consider the routing is over if the function of the route returns a value that isn't undefined. \nIf undefined is returned, the router will keep trying until a route finally has a response.\n// #=> GET /\n\nroute.define([\n  // matches but returns undefined, the router continues\n  route.get(\"/\", () => undefined),\n  // matches and returns a value, routing ends\n  route.get(\"/\", () => \"Hello\")\n])\n\nMethod\nspirit-router exports common methods besides just get.\nIt also exports: put, post, delete, head, options, patch:\nroute.define([\n  route.post(...),\n  route.delete(...)\n])\n\nIf we wanted a route to match any http method, we use any:\n  route.any(\"/test\", ...)\n\nWhich would would match any http request for path \"/test\".\nFor custom http methods that aren't pre-defined we can use method:\n  route.method(\"custom\", \"/\", ...)\n\nWhich would match for a http request with CUSTOM method for path \"/\".\nPath\nThe path of a route doesn't have to always be a string.\nThey can be a string pattern, or regexp. (They work exactly the same way as Express and other web libraries.)\nconst greet = (name) => {\n  return \"Hello, \" + name\n}\n\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/:name\", [\"name\"], greet)\n])\n// #=> GET /bob\n// { status: 200, \n//   headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\" }, \n//   body: \"Hello, bob\" }\n\nAs shown in the comment, the result is \"Hello, bob\" when we make a GET /bob request.\nIt's able to pass in name because of dependency injection (discussed also in Request).\nWhen the route matches, it'll see \"/:name\" means to hold on to the value in the path. The [\"name\"] signals greet depends on the value of \"name\" before we can call it. So \"name\" is looked up on the request and greet is called with it.\nWe can also use regexp itself, or regexp characters such as \"*\" (which matches any path):\nconst inspect = (url) => {\n  return \"You made a request to: \" + url\n}\n\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"*\", [\"url\"], inspect)\n])\n// #=> GET /test-test\n// { status: 200, \n//   headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\" }, \n//   body: \"You made a request to: /test-test\" }\n\n"},"grouping-routes.html":{"url":"grouping-routes.html","title":"Grouping Routes","keywords":"","body":"As shown previously every route must always be grouped with define:\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", ...)\n])\n\nGrouped routes can take a path too, which applies to every route inside:\nroute.define(\"/users\", [\n  route.get(\"/\", ...),    // will only match GET /users\n  route.post(\"/\", ...)    // will only match POST /users\n])\n\nComposing groups\nGroups can be composed and nested together to build out a structure:\nconst books = route.define(\"/books\", [\n  // routes for querying a Book database\n])\n\nconst users = route.define(\"/users\", [\n  // routes for querying a User database\n])\n\nconst api = route.define(\"/api\", [\n  books,   // becomes /api/books\n  users    // becomes /api/users\n])\n\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", homepage),\n  api\n])\n\nComposing this way can help us logically separate functionality in our application.\nBut it can also allow us to re-use these groups and keeping our application DRY.\nRe-using groups\nWe can already re-use functions in routes (as they are not tied to req or res and are normal javascript functions), but entire groups of routes can be re-used too.\nRemeber middleware in spirit don't just modify a request, but it can also perform operations on a response.\nSo if we take the above example to also serve pages for our \"books\" and serve API we can do:\nconst books = route.define(\"/books\", [\n  // routes for querying a Book database\n])\n\nconst users = route.define(\"/users\", [\n  // routes for querying a User database\n])\n\nconst api = route.define(\"/api\", [\n  books,   // becomes /api/books\n  users    // becomes /api/users\n])\n\nroute.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", homepage),\n  api,\n  route.wrap(books, _middleware_that_renders_to_html_)\n])\n\nIn this way we can just re-use our 'books' api to serve two purposes.\nWhen a user accesses \"/api/books\" they still get API data, and when a user access \"/books\" they get HTML pages displaying the data from our API.\nThis allows us to reduce redundancy and not have to write separate routes that call our 'books' api just to render HTML pages out of it.

But it also has access to the return value when calling handler(request), therefore we can modify both the request (input) and response (output).\nTransform request\nWe can tranform the request by changing what we pass into the next handler:\n(handler) => (request) => {\n  request.data = \"some data to pass forward\"\n  return handler(request)\n}\n\nTransform response\nNotice in our examples above we return the result of handler(request).\nBy unwinding and returning the response, middleware can also transform the response.\nThe return of handler(request) is always a Promise for async compatibility.\n(handler) => (request) => {\n  return handler(request).then((resp) => {\n    if (request.headers[\"etag\"] === resp.get(\"etag\")) resp.status = 304\n    return resp\n  })\n}\n\nIn this example we modify the response to have a 304 status code if certain conditions are met.\nRecovering From Errors\nIn the same way we can recover from errors:\nconst {response} = require(\"spirit\").node\n\n(handler) => (request) => {\n  return handler(request).catch((err) => {\n    return response(\"Recovered from \" + err)\n  })\n}\n\nWhich we can use to send back some custom response.\nAsync/Await Example\nIf you have ES7 compatibility (via babeljs) then the above examples combined will look like:\n(handler) => async (request) => { \n  const resp = await handler(request)\n  if (request.headers[\"etag\"] === resp.get(\"etag\")) resp.status = 304\n  return resp\n}\n\nInitializing\nUsually it's not needed, but you can have initialization code for your middleware:\n(handler) => {\n  // initialize middleware here\n\n  return (request) => handler(request)\n}\n\nThis code gets called once for every time your middleware is loaded. This is useful when you want to do some special setup for each instance of your middleware.\nTesting\nNotice middleware is just a closure function that takes a input (request) and returns an (output).\nThey do not deal with with req or res either, but instead a request map or response map (which are small JSON-like objects).\nThis makes testing very easy.\nFor example if we wanted to test a middleware that sets every HEAD request to be GET:\nconst middleware = (handler) => (request) => {\n  if (request.method === \"HEAD\") request.method = \"GET\"\n  return handler(request)\n}\n\n// test\nit(\"sets GET for every HEAD\", () => {\n  const test = (assertion) => (request) => expect(request.method).toBe(assertion)\n  middleware(test(\"GET\"))({ method: \"HEAD\" })\n  middleware(test(\"GET\"))({ method: \"GET\" })   // doesn't change if already GET\n  middleware(test(\"POST\"))({ method: \"POST\" }) // doesn't change if POST\n})\n\nWe don't need to mock a req object at all, we only needed to pass in an object with the same properties the middleware actually uses.\nComposing\nspirit's middleware signature may look familiar to some of you, as it's a common closure pattern.\nIt was purposely chosen because it's a natural way of composing functions together, following the motto of \"it's just javascript\". \nThere is nothing magical that happens when spirit runs or sets up our middleware together, it's basically composing (or wrapping) functions together.\nFor example if we had 3 middlewares a, b, c:\nconst final = (request) => { status: 200, headers: {}, body: \"Hello World\" }\n\n// wrap the middlewares together with `final`\nconst app = a(b(c(final)))\n\n// now we have a single function that runs through `a, b, c, final` returning the response along the way\napp(web_request)\n\n\nThis is basically what spirit does. Except spirit also ensures a Promise is always returned.\n\nYou can compose manually this way, but spirit also provides a helper function to automatically do this for you in spirit.compose.\nspirit-router.wrap also does this, but it has special handling for working with routes.\n"},"error-handling.html":{"url":"error-handling.html","title":"Error Handling","keywords":"","body":"Since spirit makes heavy use of Promises, errors in spirit aren't a burden.

Lets replace it:\nconst {response} = require(\"spirit\").node\n\nroute.render.string = (request, body) => {\n  return response(body).type(\"text\")\n}\n\nconst app = route.define([\n  route.get(\"/\", \"Hello World!\")\n])\n\nThis would apply to every string value returned from a route's function to have a Content-Type of \"text/plain\".\nNOTE: Rendering is applies to every route. If you wanted to transform a response, or do so conditionally based on certain routes, it's better to use a middleware and wrap that specific route or group of routes.\nIn our example we use spirit.node.response, which is just a helper function that helps create a response with chainable helpers with Content-Length pre-filled for us, but we could have just returned a response manually.\nRenderable Types\nrender understands and can be extended with the following types: \"string\", \"number\", \"null\", \"buffer\", \"stream\", \"file-stream\", \"array\", \"object\".\nNOTE: If a value is already a response map, it will skip the rendering process. Because the sole purpose of rendering is to convert a value to a response map.\nTemplates\nIn other web libraries there is a concept of \"template engine\".
